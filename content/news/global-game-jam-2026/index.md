The **Global Game Jam** (GGJ) is a 48-hour hackathon-style event that occurs simultaneously at hundreds of locations around the world. Game developers from all ages, experience, and skillsets gather, form teams, receive a theme, and then create games together within 48 hours. There are no winners– instead there is unbridled creativity and collaboration.

Visitors will be on guest internet, so it’d be more reliable to download large files at home before arriving. This venue was designed primarily for students with notebooks. Guests with “LAN party"-style full tower PC rigs may struggle to find comfortable spacing and wattage accommodations. Folks with large computer and electrical needs should adjust their technology footprint accordingly and consider remote participation.
Venue may fill up fast. Reach out and let us know if you have any questions.
