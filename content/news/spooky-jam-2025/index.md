## 🎮 Rules & Guidelines

Most Game Jam rules operate on the honor system. Please respect the spirit of the jam:

1. Begin work only after the theme is announced.

2. Incorporate the theme (at least loosely).
  
3. Submit a mostly-complete game by the deadline. Post-jam fixes for crashes or small bugs are acceptable, but continued development should move to a new project.

### 🚫 Strict Rules

- **Respect everyone.** Neither your behavior nor your game’s content should target, demean, or harm any person or group.

- **Keep it appropriate.** Aim for content no more mature than PG-13: no nudity, sexual content, extreme gore, excessive violence, or repeated strong language.

- Adhere to the [STLGameDev Community Guidelines](https://stlgame.dev/about/#community-guidelines).

## 🧛 Costumes

Costumes are welcome at the showcase, provided they follow the same community guidelines as outlined above.
