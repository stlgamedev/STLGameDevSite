## 🎮 Rules & Guidelines

Most Game Jam rules operate on the honor system. Please respect the spirit of the jam:

1. Begin work only after the theme is announced.

2. Incorporate the theme (at least loosely).
  
3. Games must be submitted by the deadline or they will not be presented at the showcase.

4. You are welcome to make changes to your game post-jam to fix small bugs, crashes, etc. You are also welcome (and encouraged) to continue working on your game after the jam - but please leave the version submitted for the jam as-is for posterity!

### 🚫 Strict Rules

- **Respect everyone.** Neither your behavior nor your game’s content should target, demean, or harm any person or group.

- **Keep it appropriate.** Aim for content no more mature than PG-13: no nudity, sexual content, extreme gore, excessive violence, or repeated strong language.

- Adhere to the [STLGameDev Community Guidelines](https://stlgame.dev/about/#community-guidelines).

Costumes are welcome at the showcase, provided they follow the same community guidelines as outlined above.
