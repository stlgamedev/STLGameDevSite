The [Global Game Jam (GGJ)](https://globalgamejam.org/) is a 48-hour hackathon-style event that occurs simultaneously at hundreds of locations around the world. Game developers from all ages, experience, and skillsets gather, form teams, receive a theme, and then create games together within 48 hours. There are no winners– instead there is unbridled creativity and collaboration.
